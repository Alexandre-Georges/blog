I recently joined a new company: Commit!

What does it do you ask? Well, it is simple but hard to explain!

First, I need to go back to the beginning of my career: I worked for consulting companies for 5 years and I was not able to reconcile the assignments I worked on with my values. There are a few fundamental issues with the business model of those companies, let me explain the system:

- companies, let's call them clients, make a posting explaining what they want to build

- consulting companies send their offers to those clients, telling them how much time and money it will take; this is typically done by a salesperson

- consultants then work on the project until it is done

The problems with this system is that:

- Tech workers are not able to quantify how long a task is going to take, how can salespeople figure out what would be the budget for a project that might last months or even years? We end up with a ballpark estimation at best that is overly optimistic

- Clients tend to accept the offer that has the lowest price (obviously) but, remember, quality is expensive

- Then the team starts working on that project and that's where it gets interesting. As projects are almost always underestimated the team has a really small budget and the consulting company needs to put pressure on them so they can finish as quickly as possible and be deployed on another project

- Because of that unpaid overtime becomes the norm and quality goes down. The client is not happy with the product and the team ends up exhausted

As you can imagine this is a recipe for burnouts, low quality deliverables and high turnover.

After moving to Vancouver I was really happy to leave the world of consulting and work directly for companies. Not everything was perfect but at least it was a significant improvement. I was able to manage my time to some extent and focus on maintainability and quality.

Now, let's go back to Commit. When I learned about the company I was not sure how it works. Then, I found an [article](https://www.notion.so/Commit-for-Software-Engineers-6608ecb933da4e449c16e67834ec0f4e) that explains the process very well.

The most basic way to see Commit is as a staffing company for startups: it helps startups find tech workers. However, it is much more than that: Commit hires workers guaranteeing financial stability and does the leg work to match startups and workers. The matching is semi-automatic: workers can specify their interests and experiences and they are then presented with opportunities. This is a two-way system where the worker and startup decide to interview each other. If a fit is found a pilot period starts, it lasts three months. At the end of that period if the two parties are happy they can make it official and the worker gets hired by the startup.

Another really interesting aspect is that Commit has a great community. It is easy to feel overwhelmed and isolated when working in a small team, I have been there and it can be stressful. Having a community to support you provides tremendous value, everybody can jump in and provide insights.
